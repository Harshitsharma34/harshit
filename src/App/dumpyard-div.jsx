            <p>
              Driven by vision and intention, I focus on purposeful design
              choices that amplify clarity. Each project tells a story of
              contrast, evolution, and the connection between product and human
              experience.
              <br />
              <br />I am a firm believer that design is more than just
              aesthetics. It's about solving problems that others don't have;
              it's about creating something durable and functional. This makes
              the difference between good and best-in-class products.
